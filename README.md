# Playing with Strings and Arrays in Jack Programming Language

**Playing with Strings and Arrays in Jack Programming Language** is the Semester 2 project of the subject EOC-II (Elements of Computing Systems II), created by Group 11 of Batch A.

## Introduction

The course Nand to Tetris allowed us to understand how computers work by providing us with the Nand to Tetris toolset, essential for building a simple computer. This toolset includes a programming language named Jack Programming Language, which opens up possibilities for small projects as part of the Nand to Tetris course. To explore this language in-depth and discover more possibilities for using arrays and strings, we delved into the world of Jack.

To fully understand the limits of the language and the peculiarities of its inbuilt classes, we set out to recreate a few inbuilt classes for arrays and strings. As we explored this programming language, one of the fundamental challenges was implementing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Additionally, we attempted to implement a data structure named a Queue using arrays.

## Implemented Classes

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**
  - User Interface (UI)
  - Change Interface
  - Logic
- **Queue Data Structure**
- **Morse Code**
- **StringLibrary**
  - Recreating Inbuilt Functions
  - Extended Class

## Getting Started

Before running the code, you are required to install the Nand2Tetris tool from the following website: [https://www.nand2tetris.org/](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

When the Jack code is compiled using the Jack Compiler, it generates VM files. These VM files should be loaded into the VM Emulator.

## Usage

For more information and a deeper understanding of how these projects work and how to use them, please refer to the [documentation](doc/). The "doc" folder in this repository contains a comprehensive report and presentation slides from our project presentation.
